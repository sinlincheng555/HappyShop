AuthenticationManager:
    Purpose:
    Central controller that manages all authentication operations in the system.

    Responsibilities:
    - Coordinates login and logout processes
    - Validates user credentials against the database
    - Creates and manages user sessions
    - Verifies user permissions before granting access
    - Handles authentication errors and exceptions

    Key Methods:
    - login(username, password): Authenticates user and creates session
    - logout(userId): Ends user session
    - isAuthenticated(userId): Checks if user has active session
    - verifyPermission(userId, action): Checks if user can perform action

    Handles password encryption and verification to ensure secure storage and
    comparison of user passwords.

    Responsibilities:
    - Encrypts plain text passwords before storage
    - Verifies entered passwords against stored hashes
    - Uses secure hashing algorithms (SHA-256 or bcrypt)
    - Adds salt to passwords for additional security

    Key Methods:
    - hashPassword(plainPassword): Converts password to secure hash
    - verifyPassword(plainPassword, hashedPassword): Checks if passwords match
    - generateSalt(): Creates random salt for password hashing

    Usage:
    Used by AuthenticationManager during login to verify passwords and by
    UserManagement when creating/updating user accounts.

User
