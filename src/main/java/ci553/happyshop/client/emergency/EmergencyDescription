HappyShop project - client/emergency - category

Purpose:
        Provides emergency shutdown and cleanup functionality to safely
        terminate the application and handle unexpected errors or crashes

EmergencyExit:
    Purpose:
    Handles graceful application shutdown in emergency situations, ensuring data
    is saved and resources are properly released before termination.

    Responsibilities:
    - Provides emergency shutdown mechanism for the application
    - Saves unsaved data before exit (shopping carts, pending orders)
    - Closes database connections properly
    - Releases network resources and file handles
    - Logs shutdown reason and timestamp
    - Displays shutdown notification to user
    - Prevents data loss during unexpected termination
    - Handles cleanup of temporary files
    - Closes all open windows and frames
    - Triggers cleanup routines in other components

    Key Methods:
    - triggerEmergencyExit(): Initiates emergency shutdown sequence
    - triggerEmergencyExit(reason): Shutdown with specified reason
    - saveApplicationState(): Persists current application state
    - closeAllConnections(): Closes database and network connections
    - releaseResources(): Frees up system resources
    - logShutdown(reason): Records shutdown in system logs
    - notifyUser(message): Displays shutdown message to user
    - cleanupTempFiles(): Removes temporary files
    - forceExit(exitCode): Forces immediate termination
    - registerShutdownHook(): Registers with JVM shutdown hook
    - executeCleanupTasks(): Runs cleanup task queue

    Emergency Scenarios:
    - Application crash or unhandled exception
    - User clicks emergency exit button
    - Critical system error detected
    - Database connection failure
    - Network communication failure
    - Out of memory error
    - User force-closes application window
    - System shutdown or restart
    - Critical data corruption detected

    Usage:
    Called when application encounters critical error or user requests immediate
    shutdown. Registered as JVM shutdown hook to run on abnormal termination.
    Can be triggered by pressing emergency exit button (often Ctrl+Q or dedicated
    button in UI). Used by error handlers when recoverable solution is not possible.
    Ensures application state is saved before exit.
