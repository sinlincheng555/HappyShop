HAPPYSHOP project - Client/auth category

purpose:
manages client - side authentication UI components, user login, and registration interfaces following MVC pattern

LoginController:
    Purpose:
    Controls the login process by handling user interactions, coordinating between
    the LoginView and LoginModel, and managing authentication logic on the client side.

    Responsibilities:
    - Receives user input from LoginView (username and password)
    - Validates input before sending to server
    - Communicates with LoginModel to process authentication
    - Handles login success and failure responses
    - Navigates user to appropriate screen after successful login
    - Displays error messages for failed login attempts
    - Manages "Remember Me" functionality if implemented
    - Coordinates with server-side authentication system

    Key Methods:
    - handleLogin(username, password): Processes login attempt
    - validateInput(username, password): Checks if fields are not empty
    - onLoginSuccess(user): Handles successful authentication
    - onLoginFailure(errorMessage): Handles failed authentication
    - clearLoginForm(): Resets input fields
    - showError(message): Displays error to user via view
    - navigateToMainScreen(): Redirects to main application after login

    Usage:
    Created when LoginLauncher starts the login screen. Receives events from
    LoginView when user clicks login button. Calls LoginModel to authenticate
    credentials. Updates LoginView based on authentication results. Bridges the
    gap between user interface and business logic.

LoginLauncher:
    Purpose:
    Entry point for the authentication system that initializes and launches the
    login interface when the application starts.

    Responsibilities:
    - Initializes the login window/frame
    - Creates instances of LoginController, LoginModel, and LoginView
    - Wires up MVC components (connects view to controller to model)
    - Sets up the login screen properties (size, position, visibility)
    - May check if user is already authenticated (session exists)
    - Launches registration view if user clicks "Sign Up"
    - Handles application startup sequence

    Key Methods:
    - main(args): Application entry point (if standalone)
    - initialize(): Sets up all login components
    - createLoginView(): Instantiates and configures LoginView
    - createLoginController(): Instantiates LoginController
    - createLoginModel(): Instantiates LoginModel
    - launch(): Makes login window visible
    - shutdown(): Closes login window and cleans up resources

    Usage:
    First class executed when application starts or when user needs to authenticate.
    Creates the MVC architecture for login. May be called from main application
    when user logs out. Serves as the bootstrap for the authentication UI.

LoginModel:
    Purpose:
    Manages the business logic and data for the login process, communicating with
    the server to authenticate users and maintaining login state.

    Responsibilities:
    - Sends authentication requests to server
    - Receives and processes authentication responses
    - Stores current user session information
    - Manages authentication state (logged in/out)

    - Caches user credentials if "Remember Me" is enabled
    - Validates authentication tokens
    - Manages session timeouts

    Key Methods:
    - authenticate(username, password): Sends login request to server
    - isAuthenticated(): Checks if user is currently logged in
    - getCurrentUser(): Returns currently logged in user object
    - logout(): Clears session and user data
    - saveSession(user): Stores user session locally
    - clearSession(): Removes stored session data
    - validateToken(token): Verifies authentication token is valid
    - handleAuthenticationResponse(response): Processes server response

    Usage:
    Called by LoginController to perform actual authentication. Communicates
    with server-side authentication system. Notifies controller of success or
    failure. Maintains user session throughout application lifecycle. Used by
    other parts of application to check authentication status.
